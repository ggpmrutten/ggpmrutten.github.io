# Interactions between roots, fungal mutualists and pathogens  
A considerable part of the biosphere is hidden belowground. Recent advances in ecological methods help to better understand how various intertwined life forms interact. By combining plant-soil feedback experiments with microbial sequencing approaches, we try to disentangle the impact of various fungal components on plant-plant interactions and plant diversity. Additionally, we ask how mutualistic, pathogenic and plant interactions are affected by changing environmental conditions, like global warming or increasing summer droughts. Finally, we aim to understand how these interactions affect ecosystem functioning as a whole and how these interactions contribution to the services various ecosystems provide for human wellbeing. 

## About me
Gemma Rutten received her PhD from university of Bern, where she studied how climate and land use change the vegetation structure of various ecotypes on Mt Kilimanjaro. With a mobility grant of the Swiss National Science Foundation, she studied the effects of soil biota on Mediterranean oak recruitment over a precipitation gradient in Southern Spain. She was subsequently a postdoctoral researcher, at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) and the Martin Luther University (MLU) in Germany where she studied the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning, focussing on links between plants and foliar fungi in the phyllosphere, in a Chinese subtropical forests experiment [BEF-China](https://bef-china.com/index.html).  She was a postdoctoral researcher at Alpine Ecology Laboratory, University Grenoble Alpes (LECA), Grenoble, France, before moving back to the University of Bern, where she is a researcher and lecturer in the [Allan Ecology](https://allanecology.com/) group. Gemma’s research focusses on belowground plant interactions mediated by mutualistic and pathogenic fungi and how these interactions respond to global change.

### Root traits & Plant soil feedbacks 
Plant-soil feedbacks have been recognised as playing a key role in a range of ecological processes, including succession, invasion, species coexistence and population dynamics. However, there is substantial variation between species in the strength of plant-soil feedbacks and predicting this variation remains challenging. Here, we propose an original concept to predict the outcome of plant-soil feedbacks. We hypothesize that plants with different combinations of root traits culture different proportions of pathogens and mutualists in their soils and that this contributes to differences in performance between home soils (cultured by conspecifics) versus away soils (cultured by heterospecifics). We use the recently described root economics space, which identifies two gradients in root traits. A conservation gradient distinguishes fast vs. slow species, and from growth defence theory we predict that these species culture different amounts of pathogens in their soils. A collaboration gradient distinguishes species that associate with mycorrhizae to outsource soil nutrient acquisition vs. those which use a “do it yourself” strategy and capture nutrients without relying strongly on mycorrhizae. We provide a framework, which predicts that the strength and direction of the biotic feedback between a pair of species is determined by the dissimilarity between them along each axis of the root economics space. We then use data from two case studies to show how to apply the framework, by analysing the response of plant-soil feedbacks to measures of distance and position along each axis and find some support for our predictions. Finally, we highlight further areas where our framework could be developed and propose study designs that would help to fill current research gaps.

### Climate dependency of Plant soil feedbacks
Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) have been shown to be relevant drivers of forest community dynamics. However, few studies have explored variation of PSFs along environmental gradients. In a framework of climate change, there is a great need to understand how interactions between plants and soil microbes respond along climatic gradients. Therefore, we compared PSFs along a precipitation gradient in Mediterranean oak forests and included trait responses. Following the Stress Gradient Hypothesis (SGH), we expected less negative or even positive PSFs in the physically harsh dry end of our gradient and more negative PSFs in the wettest end. We grew Quercus ilex and Quercus suber acorns on soil inoculated with microbes sampled under adults of both species in six sites ranging in annual precipitation. After 4 months, we measured shoot biomass and allocation and morphological traits above and belowground. We found negative PSFs for Q. ilex independent of precipitation, whereas for Q. suber PSFs ranged from positive in dry sites to negative in wet sites, in agreement with the SGH. The leaf allocation showed patterns similar to shoot biomass, but belowground allocation and morphological traits revealed responses which could not be detected aboveground. We provide first evidence for context-dependent PSFs along a precipitation gradient. Moreover, we show that measuring root traits can help improve our understanding of climate-dependent PSFs. Such understanding helps to predict plant soil microbe interactions, and their role as drivers of plant community dynamics under ongoing climate change.

### Importance of plant and fungal diversity for ecosystem functioning 
Fungal pathogens have the potential to affect plant biogeography and ecosystem processes through their influence on the fitness and functioning of their plant hosts. Simultaneously, changes in plant communities can influence fungal pathogen communities. Exactly which host plant attributes determine the composition of fungal pathogen communities on the leaves remains poorly understood. We characterized foliar fungal pathogen communities in subtropical tree communities along an experimental diversity gradient in Jiangxi, South-East China. On 32 tree species, we identified all visible fungal structures and symptoms microscopically and studied fungi-specific traits such as conidia or spores in detail. We asked how different facets of biodiversity, including taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional tree diversity, shape fungal diversity and fungal infestation at different scales. We found a positive relationship between tree richness and fungal richness at the plot level. At the level of individual trees of the same species, the relationship between tree species richness and fungal species richness was marginally significantly negative. Importantly, the fungal infestation rates decreased as tree species richness increased, suggesting that colonization of hosts by specialist fungi was impeded by dilution of the pool of available hosts. Moreover, we found evidence for similar topologies between phylogenetic topologies of trees and fungal genera which is a precondition for coevolution and we identified leaf traits, including leaf habit (deciduous/evergreen), leaf magnesium content and stomata size that predicted fungal richness and infestation. Synthesis. Our study indicates that host tree species harbour different foliar fungal pathogens, which sums up to the highest fungal pathogen richness in more diverse forest stands. At the same time, the foliar fungal pathogen infestation rate for each tree species decreased with increasing tree richness in forests. We identified leaf traits that can help to better predict fungal pathogen richness and infestation, and we show that phylogenetically closely related tree species harbour phylogenetically closely related foliar fungal pathogens. These new insights might be helpful to improve the pest resilience of future forests and plantations.
